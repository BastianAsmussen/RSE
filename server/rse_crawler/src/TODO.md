# ToDo
- [x] Normalize/Filter URLs.
- [x] Add `pages`, `metadata` and `forward links` to database.
- [ ] Add a handler for `robots.txt` (check with `origin URL`, if `None`, it is the origin URL, and it probably hasn't been checked).
- [ ] Add a handler for `sitemap.xml` (check with `origin URL`, if `None`, it is the origin URL, and it probably hasn't been checked).
- [ ] Load data from database, if it's empty, load seed URLs.
